# **Cranial Nerves Tract Segmentation -- CNTSeg**

---

Due to the slender structure of cranial nerves (CNs) and the complex anatomical environment, single-modality data based on dMRI cannot provide a complete and accurate description. CNs tract segmentation is the strategy of voxel-wise analysis, which directly classifies voxels based on associated fiber bundles, bypassing traditional streamline analysis. CNTSeg has achieved the segmentation of 5 pairs of CNs (i.e. optic nerve *CN II*, oculomotor nerve *CN III*, trigeminal nerve *CN V*, and facial–vestibulocochlear nerve *CN VII/VIII*).

# **How to use**

---
- For CNTSeg

```
python Pre_data.py ## Crop the HCP data (i.e., T1w and dMRI data) with a spatial resolutionof 145×174×145 voxels to 128×160×128 voxels; normalize the T1w images and dMRI data from 0 to 255.
python createmydata.py ## Obtaining training and testing data
python train_mutil_T1.py; python train_mutil_FA.py; python train_mutil_peaks.py ## Find the best weights for single modalities separately
python train_CNTSeg_V1.py ## Load the best weights of a single modality to train the CNTSeg
python predict_CNTSeg_V1.py ## validate mode
```

Note: Use the MRtrix3 to process primary DWI data and get the corresponding FA images and Peaks images; The Human Connectome Project dataset is available at [https://db.humanconnectome.org](https://db.humanconnectome.org/).
